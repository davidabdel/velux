# Skylight Selector – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** Skylight Selector

**Purpose:**
A guided, mistake-proof skylight selection tool that allows non-technical staff to confidently identify valid skylight configurations for customers by progressively narrowing options based on constraints.

The system must prevent invalid combinations by design and feel premium, calm, and effortless to use.

**Primary Outcome:**
At the end of the flow, the staff member can:

* See **only valid skylight options**
* Export or copy a **clear product recommendation summary**
* Avoid any technical skylight knowledge

---

## 2. Target Users

### Primary User

* Internal sales / admin staff
* No skylight or building knowledge
* Needs certainty and speed

### Secondary User

* Manager / installer reviewing outputs

---

## 3. Core Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure** – One decision per screen
2. **No Dead Ends** – User can never select an invalid option
3. **Always Explain Why** – Gentle guidance, not rules
4. **Luxury Feel** – Calm spacing, soft motion, neutral palette
5. **Mobile-First** – Works perfectly on iPad / phone

---

## 4. Data Model (Source: data.md)

The selector relies on a structured dataset defining:

* Skylight types
* Size codes
* Dimensions
* Compatible openings
* Compatible blinds
* Compatible flashings
* Orientation constraints
* Roof type constraints

**Key Rule:**
The UI never shows raw data — it only consumes filtered results.

---

## 5. User Flow (High Level)

1. Start New Selection
2. Identify Roof Type
3. Identify Installation Type
4. Select Opening Type
5. Select Size Constraints
6. Filter Valid Products
7. Optional Add-ons
8. Summary & Export

---

## 6. Step-by-Step Flow

### Step 1: Roof Type

**Question:** What type of roof does the client have?

**Options:**

* Tiled roof
* Corrugated metal roof
* Wide-span metal roof (Trimdek / Klip-Lok)
* Flat roof

**Logic:**

* Filters flashing compatibility
* Flat roof immediately routes to FCM-only flow

---

### Step 2: Installation Type

**Question:** Is this a new installation or a replacement?

**Options:**

* New installation
* Replacement (existing skylight)

**Logic:**

* Replacement prompts size-matching priority

---

### Step 3: Opening Preference

**Question:** Does the skylight need to open?

**Options:**

* Fixed (does not open)
* Manual opening
* Electric opening
* Solar powered opening

**Logic:**

* Instantly removes incompatible models

---

### Step 4: Roof Pitch / Orientation (if applicable)

**Question:** Is the skylight intended to be installed in portrait or landscape orientation?

**Options:**

* Portrait
* Landscape
* Not sure

**Logic:**

* Removes restricted sizes (e.g. FCM 2270 / 3072 / 4672 landscape)
* If "Not sure", defaults to safest compatible options

---

### Step 5: Size Constraints

**Question:** What is limiting the skylight size?

**Options:**

* Rafter spacing
* Ceiling opening size
* Flexible / customer preference

**UI Pattern:**

* Visual size cards
* Only valid sizes shown

---

### Step 6: Product Results

**Display:**

* 1–3 recommended skylights (never more)
* Best match highlighted

Each card shows:

* Product name
* Size code
* Dimensions
* Opening type
* Why it’s recommended

---

### Step 7: Optional Add-ons

**Questions:**

* Does the client want light control?
* Does the client want room darkening?
* Is insect protection required?

**Logic:**

* Only compatible blinds shown
* Auto-add required accessories (e.g. ZZZ 199 trays)

---

### Step 8: Summary & Export

**Summary Panel Includes:**

* Selected skylight (highlighted)
* Product code
* Opening type
* Size & dimensions
* Compatible flashing
* Compatible blinds
* Auto-required accessories (included by default)
* Explicit exclusions (what does *not* apply)

**Pricing Ticket (Always Visible):**

* Skylight RRP
* Add-ons RRP (itemised)
* Total indicative price (supply only)

**Included / Not Included Clarity:**

* ✅ Included with this configuration
* ❌ Not compatible / not required

**Actions:**

* Copy summary
* Export PDF
* Save selection

---

## 7. UI / UX Direction

### Visual Style

* Background: Soft off-white / stone
* Accent: Muted charcoal, warm grey
* Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter / SF Pro style)
* Corners: Rounded (12–16px)
* Shadows: Soft, minimal

### Motion

* Gentle fade + slide transitions
* No abrupt state changes
* Loading skeletons instead of spinners

---

## 8. Error Prevention Strategy

* No free-text inputs where possible
* All choices driven by filtered data
* Disabled options instead of error messages
* Friendly microcopy for guidance

Example:

> “Based on the roof type, this option isn’t recommended — we’ve hidden it for you.”

---

## 9. Technical Expectations

### Frontend

* React / Next.js
* Tailwind CSS
* Framer Motion

### Data Layer

* data.md parsed into structured JSON
* Rule engine filters combinations

### State Management

* Step-based finite state machine
* Undo / back always available

---

## 10. Success Metrics

* Staff can complete a selection in < 2 minutes
* Zero invalid combinations produced
* No training required

---

## 11. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

* Installer quoting
* CRM sync
* Public-facing selector
* AI-assisted recommendations

---

## 12. Non-Goals

* Teaching skylight theory
* Showing all available products
* Custom engineering calculations

---

## 13. Final Note

This tool should feel like a **luxury concierge**, not a configurator.

The user should never feel unsure — only guided.
